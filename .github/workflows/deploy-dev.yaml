name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the develop branch
  push:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
